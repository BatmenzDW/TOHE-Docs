<summary><b><font color=gray>TOHE-DATA Info</font></b></summary>

Open the root directory of game: `...\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\`

There are a few files:

- `BanList.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will be unable to join your lobby.
- `Default_Teamplate.txt`: This is the Default TOHE Template file. If you wish to reset your templates to default, You can use this. (No idea why it says Teamplate.)
- `DenyName.txt`: A list of names that will be filtered out of the game.
- `Moderators.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will receive a nice Moderator tag (editable via `...\Among Us\Language\english.dat`) as well as permissions to moderate your lobby (such as using the commands near the top of the page). Only grant users you trust these permissions! (NOTE: `english.dat` is only if you are on the English Translation of base game Among Us. If you are using another Translation, please rename the english part to the translation you are using. (ie: `Spanish.dat/SChinese.dat/Latam.dat`/so on.) A list of all base game supported translations can be found on the [Resources](./Resources.html) Page.)
- `template.txt`: You can modify the `welcome` and `onMeeting` messages here. You can also add custom templates here as well following the same format as `welcome` & `onMeeting` use.
- `VIP-List.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will be given a sweet VIP tag (editable via `...\Among Us\Language\english.dat`) as well as permissions to change their name color. (NOTE: `english.dat` is only if you are on the English Translation of base game Among Us. If you are using another Translation, please rename the english part to the translation you are using. (ie: `Spanish.dat/SChinese.dat/Latam.dat`/so on.) A list of all base game supported translations can be found on the [Resources](./Resources.html) Page.)
- `WhiteList.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will be exempt from blacklisted platforms, along with level requirements.

<summary><b><font color=gray>Templates Info</font></b></summary>

Open the root directory of the mod and find the `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\template.txt` file.

You can see that there are some words in the file, such as `welcome`, `onMeeting`, and other gibberish.
- `welcome:exampleMessage` - this is the message that will be sent when other players enter your lobby.
- `onMeeting:exampleMessage` - this is the message that will be sent when each meeting starts. 
- `onFirstMeeting:exampleMessage` - this is just like `onMeeting`, but the message sent here will only be sent on the <i>first</i> meeting. Any meetings after will prioritize `onMeeting`. 

You can edit these templates, or add your own on new-lines!

On a new-line, you want to add your trigger word and your message. Such as: `[example]:this is an example template!` <i>(The trigger word being `[example]` and the message being `this is an example template!`. (YOU NEED THE `:`!))</i> You can add as many of these as you want. You can then save the file, boot up the mod, and run `/t [example]` in your chat box to see if it's set up to your liking!

Alternatively, you may also use this [Template Editor](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/editor.html) put together by one of TOHE's Contributors, [Drakos](https://github.com/Ultradragon005).

<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>Guide</font></b></summary>

There is a Tutorial at the bottom of the Template Editior's page if you need it. If you do not want to watch it, here's a small guide abounht how to use it.

1. Enter a Title for the template. This title will be displayed at the top of the template when its activated in game. Here's what the title will look like by default:
![image](./images/TemplateTitle.png)
2. Enter in what you want the template to display. You can edit the Font Size & Text Colors, but it is recommended to do it last. (From: Drakos)
3. Enter in the name for this template. This name will also be the trigger word for this template. `[example]:this is an example template!` (`[example]` being the name/trigger word)
4. Click the "Copy as HTML Formatted" to copy your template to your clipboard.
5. Locate `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\template.txt` and paste your new template on a new-line.
6. You can then save the file [`[Ctrl] + [S]`], boot up the mod, and run `/t [example]` in your chat box to see if it's set up to your liking!
</details>

If you create copies of the template name on newlines, it will send them in seperate messages. Here's an example from Drakos:

<summary><b><font color=gray>Template Editor</font></b></summary>

Here's a Template Editor which you can use to edit or create templates.<br>
[Template Editor](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/editor.html)<br>

The Template Editor is only 1 of the many Utilities (Also by Drakos) which are on this [Among Us Utilities](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/index.html) page. You can find a [Welcome Message Guide](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/guide.html), [Pixel Art Editor](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/pixelgrid.html), [Gallery](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/gallery.html), & also the [Template Editor](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/editor.html) shown already.<br><br>

<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>template.dat Info</font></b></summary>

You can edit your `template.dat` to say really anything you want! You can also download custom templates shared by others. If you want to use one, make sure the file is renamed to `english.dat` before using it, if it isn't already. (NOTE: english.dat is only if you are on the English Translation of base game Among Us. If you are using another Translation, please rename the english part to the translation you are using. (ie: `Spanish.dat/SChinese.dat/Latam.dat`/so on.) A list of all base game supported translations can be found on the [Resources](./Resources.html) Page.)<br><br>

Note: You have to put the file in the following directory: `.\Among Us\Language` for it to work. (Make sure your file is a `.dat` file, otherwise it will not work. Paste it alongside the `template.dat` file already in your folder.)<br><br>

You can do a lot with your `template.dat`, for this though, we'll refer to it as `english.dat` for simplicity sake. For starters, you can edit the Host Text, Icon, & Color. I won't go into depth on <i>everything</i> that the `english.dat` can edit, but it's almost every line of text that can be displayed on the screen. Once you get the hang of editing the Host Text, Icon, & Color, you can move down the list to edit anything you really want to (Such as Role Names, Role Descriptions, VIP Text, Moderator Text, and more).<br>
Below is what the default `template.dat` looks like, Versus what the edited `english.dat` I have looks like.<br>
![image](./images/HostTextDefault.png)<br>
Versus what the edited `english.dat` I have looks like.<br>
![image](./images/HostTextEdited.png)<br><br>

Just mess around a little bit, and have fun! Make sure you copy your template as a backup before you try messing with it again, or messing with the mod itself.<br>
