<p>As the Devourer, you use your shapeshift to permanently change the appearance of the target of the shapeshift. Additionally, for each player's appearance changed, your kill cooldown is reduced by a defined number of seconds. If the Devourer dies or gets voted out during a meeting, the player's appearance will change back to their normal appearance.</p>
