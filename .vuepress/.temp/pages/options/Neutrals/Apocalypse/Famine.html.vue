<p>Once the Baker has the set amount of people with bread alive, they will become Famine. If Famine is not voted out after the meeting they become Famine, every player without bread will starve (excluding other Apocalypse members). After this starvation of everyone without bread, Famine can use their kill button to starve any remaining players, which will kill those players right before the next meeting.<br>
<b>You are invincible and your presence is announced to everyone at the meeting after you transform.</b></p>
