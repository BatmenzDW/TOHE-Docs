<p>You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others.</p>
<p>If you are new to hosting and don't know what to enable, there are also some <b>Starter Presets</b> below. Once you have a bit of a grasp on some roles and some special perks, you can try out some <b>Advanced Presets</b>, unless you think you're ready to try out <b>Expert Presets</b>, which include a lot of complex roles and perks.<br>
If you want to try out what some community members roll with, you can try downloading one of the many <i>Member Submitted Presets</i>, which are sorted by the above system.</p>
<p>For Instructions on how to Install Presets, visit the bottom of <RouteLink to="/Install.html">This Page</RouteLink>.</p>
<p>Keep in Mind: It is always suggested to just roll with whatever you like! If you see any roles you may like or are simply interested in, enable them, and mess with them to your personal liking!</p>
<p>You can submit your own preset to be featured by joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/ten" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Server<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, heading to #website-feedback, and creating a forum post with the Preset tag.</p>
