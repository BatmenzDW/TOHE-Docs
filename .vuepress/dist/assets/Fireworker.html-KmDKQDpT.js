Whispered a voice... Sensei? Cried the Impostor as he was terrified to hear the familiar voice... Chapter 1 Teach me After becoming a new Impostor the Fireworker was teamed up with the bomber who taught him how to make bombs on the go... and so he did... Now the main plan was how to use them and one of the best ways was... Deploying them around the map mainly the reactor... Chapter 2 Last words The bomber was stabbed by the medusa and as he was converting to stone he muttered the last words... Kaboom Going around depressed the Fireworker had lost the will to live without his best friend until he thought... What if I ignite all the bombs altogether This would require so much energy that the Fireworker would Die... Chapter 3 Finally and now Now the Fireworker placed down the bombs and went to call a meeting he outed the medusa and after the meeting he called a critical reactor sabotage... The crewmates went there like moths to a flame and well... Kaboom Chapter 4 I won Now all the beans Died from the bombs and... The sparks went up in the sky like fireworks... This was fun and all but doing all this took so much energy... I just need to close my eyes As he won since all the remaining crew died... The Fireworker won... But at his own life's cost The end?
