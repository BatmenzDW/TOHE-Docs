They worked together for The Mastermind, playing tricks and executing plans, always ready to support one another. Their friendship was strong, but everything changed one fateful day.</p><p>Chapter 1: The Prank Backfires One morning, as they drove to work, The Inhibitor decided to play a prank on The Saboteur by tampering with his car. However, the prank went awry, and they accidentally struck a mysterious figure in the road. Panic set in as they jumped out to assess the situation.</p><p>The Inhibitor: “Oh, I’m so sorry! The car was sabotaged!” Mysterious Figure: “Both of you! You’ve caused enough trouble in this town. What should your punishment be?”</p><p>Terrified, they sped away, realizing the gravity of their mistake.</p><p>Chapter 2: A Strange Curse After the incident, The Saboteur found himself unable to complete any kills. Frustration mounted as he failed repeatedly, and he wondered if the mysterious figure&#39;s words had cursed him.</p><p>The Saboteur: “This is the fifth time! Do you think what that strange guy said was true?” The Inhibitor: “Maybe... it started after the accident.”</p><p>Desperate to regain his skills, The Saboteur vowed to find the source of his misfortune.</p><p>Chapter 3: Confrontation and Guilt When he stumbled upon a newspaper article hinting at the incident, he confronted The Inhibitor.</p><p>The Saboteur: “Did you really sabotage my car?!” The Inhibitor: “It was just supposed to be a little revenge!” The Saboteur: “A LITTLE?! I can’t kill anymore because of you!”</p><p>The tension escalated into an argument, and in the heat of the moment, they parted ways, leaving their friendship in tatters.</p><p>Chapter 4: A Heavy Heart The Inhibitor felt a deep sense of guilt for what had happened. Every time a sabotage occurred during missions, she was reminded of their broken bond. The weight of their conflict made it nearly impossible for her to act as an impostor.</p><p>Now, when sabotages occurred, The Inhibitor would hesitate, unable to strike while memories of their friendship haunted her. The Saboteur&#39;s curse lingered, a reminder that sometimes, the bonds we forge can become our greatest challenges.</p><p>Epilogue: As time passed, both impostors learned that their actions had consequences, shaping not only their fates but also their friendship. Now, when sabotage was needed, it was a race against time—because stalling could stall The Inhibitor.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: burgerman7286</p></blockquote>",14);function T(I,k){const i=n("font"),r=n("Badge"),s=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return l(),d("div",null,[e("h1",p,[e("a",m,[e("span",null,[o(i,{color:"red"},{default:a(()=>[t("🛡️ "),b]),_:1}),t(),o(r,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),g,f,y,e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[t('From: "Idea & Coding": '),e("a",w,[t("TheSkullCreeper"),o(s)])])]),e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[o(i,{color:"gray"},{default:a(()=>[t("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),_])])}const v=h(c,[["render",T],["__file","Inhibitor.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/Inhibitor.html","title":"Inhibitor","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Inhibitor","prev":"Hangman","next":"Instigator"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1728767165000,"contributors":[{"name":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":10},{"name":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":4}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/Inhibitor.md"}');export{v as comp,x as data};
