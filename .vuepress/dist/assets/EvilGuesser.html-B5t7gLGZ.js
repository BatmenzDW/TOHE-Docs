His eyes landed on a headline: “Hiring Detectives and Sleuths.” This could change everything for him.</p><p>Chapter 2: Back to HQ</p><p>“Ah, HQ. Brings back memories,” Sherlock thought as he entered the familiar space for his first game. While completing tasks, he stumbled upon a lifeless body. He examined it closely for clues and noticed distinct handprints. This discovery could lead him to the truth.</p><p>Chapter 3: The Accusation</p><p>Sherlock rushed to the lobby to share his findings. “I know who the killer is: John is Hangman.” Overcome with guilt, John felt he had no way out and took drastic action. “Well, that’s that,” Sherlock said, feeling the weight of his words.</p><p>Chapter 4: Another Target</p><p>During the next meeting, Sherlock made another bold claim. “I think Joe is the captain, based on his hands.” Unfortunately, this led to another innocent being ejected. “That’s another good person gone,” he thought, regret flooding in.</p><p>Chapter 5: A Descent into Darkness</p><p>“What have I done?” Sherlock whispered, looking at the metaphorical stains on his hands. As meetings continued, he felt a growing thrill from manipulating the game, unable to resist the urge to play the part of the deceiver.</p><p>Chapter 6: A New Identity</p><p>The Godfather watched Sherlock&#39;s transformation with interest. “You’ve shown great skill, my friend,” he said, recognizing Sherlock’s potential.</p><p>“What name will you go by now?” he asked.</p><p>“I… don’t know,” Sherlock replied, grappling with his new persona.</p><p>“Let’s give you a title that fits. How about ‘The Evil Guesser’?”</p><p>Sherlock smiled, feeling a surge of confidence. “I like that.”</p><p>Embracing his new identity, he delved deeper into deception, crafting elaborate schemes that left others in disarray. He eventually got admired and took out his team one by one.</p><p>The End</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",21);function S(O,T){const n=s("font"),a=s("Badge"),i=s("ExternalLinkIcon");return h(),d("div",null,[e("h1",p,[e("a",m,[e("span",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("🔪 "),g]),_:1}),t(),o(a,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),f,_,v,b,e("ul",null,[k,y,e("li",null,[t("Can Guess "),o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("Impostor")]),_:1}),t(" Roles "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"green"},{default:l(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": the Evil Guesser can guess Impostors")]),e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(": the Evil Guesser cannot guess Impostors")])])]),e("li",null,[t("Can Guess Add-Ons "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"green"},{default:l(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": the Evil Guesser can guess players' Add-Ons")]),e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(": the Evil Guesser cannot guess based off of Add-Ons")])])]),e("li",null,[t("Can guess Snitch with All Tasks Done "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"green"},{default:l(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": the Evil Guesser can guess the Snitch when the Snitch is finished all of their Tasks")]),e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(": the Evil Guesser cannot guess the Snitch once the Snitch finishes all of their Tasks")])])]),e("li",null,[t("Try to hide guesser's command "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"green"},{default:l(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": the mod will attempt to hide the Evil Guesser’s commands")]),e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(": the mod will not care to hide the Evil Guesser’s commands")])])])]),e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[t("From: TheOtherRoles, Coding: "),e("a",w,[t("KARPED1EM"),o(i)]),t("、"),e("a",E,[t("Commandf1"),o(i)])])]),e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[o(n,{color:"gray"},{default:l(()=>[t("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),G])])}const x=r(u,[["render",S],["__file","EvilGuesser.html.vue"]]),A=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/EvilGuesser.html","title":"Evil Guesser","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Evil Guesser","prev":"Deathpact","next":"EvilHacker"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1728767165000,"contributors":[{"name":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":3},{"name":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/EvilGuesser.md"}');export{x as comp,A as data};
