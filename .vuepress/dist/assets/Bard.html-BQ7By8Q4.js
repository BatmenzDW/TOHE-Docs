I was in that once,” The Bomber recalled, grinning. “It tasted funny. You should give it a try; it’ll be fun!”</p><p>“Hmmm… they do say curiosity killed the cat,” Arro mused.

It’s literally you, but… more nerdy!” The Bomber exclaimed, barely containing his laughter.</p><p>“Let’s show it to the boss,” Arro suggested, intrigued by the potential.</p><p>An Unexpected Mission</p><p>The Mind, curious about this new development, decided to send The Arrogance and the newly acquired Bard on a mission.

Moreover, after each ejection, the Bard’s cooldown was halved.</p><p>“This is definitely something special,” The Arrogance concluded. Thus, he became known as The Bard—a unique force within the game.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: burgerman7286</p></blockquote>",20);function w(v,B){const n=a("font"),i=a("Badge"),s=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return d(),c("div",null,[e("h1",u,[e("a",m,[e("span",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:r(()=>[t("🎻 "),g]),_:1}),t(),o(i,{text:"Hidden",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),b,f,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("You must have “Disable Hidden Roles” toggled "),o(n,{color:"red"},{default:r(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(" for this to have a chance to appear")])]),e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[t("From: Idea & Coding: "),e("a",_,[t("KARPED1EM"),o(s)])])]),e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[o(n,{color:"gray"},{default:r(()=>[t("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),y])])}const k=l(p,[["render",w],["__file","Bard.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Secondary/bard.html","title":"Bard","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Bard","prev":"Arrogance","next":"Arrogance"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":null,"contributors":[]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Secondary/bard.md"}');export{k as comp,x as data};
