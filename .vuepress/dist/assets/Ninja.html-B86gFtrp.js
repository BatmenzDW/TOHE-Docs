The lights had gone out, and a shadowy figure darted through the darkness, leaving chaos in its wake. Blood spattered the walls, and the sense of impending doom hung heavily in the air.</p><p>Chapter 2: Flashback</p><p>“Ah, what a great day!” thought the scientist, immersed in his research on nanoparticles. He envisioned a groundbreaking technology that would enhance agility and stealth. This invention was meant as a gift for the sheriff. With a stroke of genius, he created the Ninja Suit. This suit could mark a target and then render the wearer invisible for a brief moment. In an instant, the wearer could shift from one location to another—one moment in Electrical, the next in Admin.</p><p>Chapter 3: Back to Reality</p><p>Back in the present, the crewmates were on edge, struggling to navigate the pitch-black environment. One crewmate, frustrated by a mischievous fellow flicking the wrong switches, suddenly heard a chilling SLASH. Panic set in as two crewmates whispered urgently to each other.</p><p>“Where is he? Where is he?” “Keep your head down; he’s aiming for the lights!” “He’s using the darkness to conceal his approach!”</p><p>Another SLASH echoed through the air—three kills in mere seconds. The remaining crewmates realized they were in grave danger.</p><p>Chapter 4: Sabotage Resolved</p><p>“Finally!” exclaimed one crewmate as he fixed the sabotage, just in time to spot the shadowy figure nearby. With only three crewmates left, they were at a disadvantage. The agile Ninja was a master of evasion. Believing he was safe, they ejected an innocent crewmate, thinking they had eliminated the threat.</p><p>But the Ninja had been in control the entire time. Once a brilliant scientist, he had succumbed to the temptation of his own creation. “Why should I share this gift?” he thought. “It’s mine—only mine!”</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In the end, technology can be both a healer and a harbinger of chaos. The Ninja, once a scientist driven by innovation, now embraced his darker side, proving that brilliance can lead to ruin.</p><p>The End</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",15);function j(v,S){const a=o("font"),s=o("Badge"),l=o("ExternalLinkIcon");return h(),c("div",null,[e("h1",u,[e("a",p,[e("span",null,[n(a,{color:"red"},{default:i(()=>[t("🥷 "),g]),_:1}),t(),n(s,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),f,n(a,{size:"3em"},{default:i(()=>[t("Formerly known as Assassin")]),_:1}),_,e("ul",null,[w,b,k,e("li",null,[t("Can kill after Assassinating "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[n(a,{color:"green"},{default:i(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": the Ninja can kill once it successfully assassinates someone")]),e("li",null,[n(a,{color:"red"},{default:i(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(": the Ninja can only Assassinate people to kill")])])])]),e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[t("From: TOHR & Coding: "),e("a",y,[t("KARPED1EM"),n(l)])])]),e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[n(a,{color:"gray"},{default:i(()=>[t("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),N])])}const T=r(m,[["render",j],["__file","Ninja.html.vue"]]),A=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/Ninja.html","title":"Ninja","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Ninja","prev":"Mercenary","next":"QuickShooter"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1735713408000,"contributors":[{"name":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":4},{"name":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/Ninja.md"}');export{T as comp,A as data};
