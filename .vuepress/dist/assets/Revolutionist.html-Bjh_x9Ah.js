Players have a chance of being killed immediately after being recruited (the host sets the probability). When the specified number of players are recruited (the number is set by the host) and they vent within the specified time, the Revolutionist and all the players who are recruited win; if not, the recruited player dies; if the Revolutionist is killed during the countdown, nothing happens; if a meeting is held, the Revolutionist dies.
