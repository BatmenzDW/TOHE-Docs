He had a knack for understanding emotions, and he patiently awaited his moment.</p><p>Two Years Later</p><p>The Instigator was done waiting. Today was the best day of his life—he had finally become an impostor! He possessed a unique talent: the ability to instill fear, anger, and guilt in others.</p><p>Game 1: The Beginning of Chaos</p><p>The Instigator was on a roll, having taken down three crewmates in quick succession. He craved more chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, the game took a turn.

The reporter was actually a marshal who still had tasks to complete.</p><p>With two impostors remaining, the Instigator seized the opportunity. He approached one of those who had voted against him.</p><p>“He was innocent! You’ve ruined his chance! You’re a monster for doing this,” he said, dripping with feigned concern. “You can’t let this go. We can’t have someone like you in our midst!”</p><p>Gaslighting 101</p><p>His manipulative skills were effective; the crewmate began to crumble under the weight of guilt and doubt. In a moment of despair, they took drastic action against themselves.</p><p>With his cunning instigation, the Instigator remained hidden in the shadows, his identity safe. He reveled in the success of his tactics, knowing he had outsmarted them all.</p><p>“This much waiting was worth it,” he murmured, ready for his next games at Mira HQ.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",15);function y(b,k){const o=a("font"),l=a("Badge"),r=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return d(),c("div",null,[e("h1",u,[e("a",m,[e("span",null,[i(o,{color:"red"},{default:n(()=>[t("🤬 "),g]),_:1}),t(),i(l,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),f,e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[t("Idea & Coding: "),e("a",w,[t("lars-wu (papercut)"),i(r)])])]),e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[i(o,{color:"gray"},{default:n(()=>[t("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),_])])}const I=h(p,[["render",y],["__file","instigator.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/impostors/killing/instigator.html","title":"Instigator","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Instigator","prev":"Inhibitor","next":"KillingMachine"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":null,"contributors":[]},"filePathRelative":"options/impostors/killing/instigator.md"}');export{I as comp,x as data};
