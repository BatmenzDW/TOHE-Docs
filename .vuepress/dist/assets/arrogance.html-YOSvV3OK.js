When would these bullies learn their lesson? “Yes?” he replied, trying to keep his cool as he braced for impact. Just then, a basketball came flying at him. “Damn it…” he muttered, wiping a smudge of blood from his nose. “How’d you like that, sucker?” the bully jeered. “Not that well,” he shot back, frustration bubbling inside him. “See you at recess!” The bully laughed as he walked away, leaving him feeling defeated.</p><p>Chapter 1: The Dark Plan He was tired of being pushed around. If I ever get the chance, I’ll show them. A bold thought sparked in his mind. What if I could become stronger?</p><p>Determined to change his fate, he dove into research. He was tech-savvy but had no experience standing up to bullies. But that was about to change. Days turned into weeks as he studied, planning his comeback with careful strategy.</p><p>Chapter 2: The Day of Transformation Finally, the day came when he decided enough was enough. He stood up a little straighter and set his sights on his goal.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Mira HQ, a group of friends were joking around, unaware of the change happening in their midst. “Who’s our target today, boss?” one of them asked playfully. “Just stay focused. We’re here to have fun, remember?” replied their leader, grinning.</p><p>Chapter 3: A New Approach But our protagonist, inspired by newfound courage, stepped forward. He approached the bullies with a calm determination. “This ends now. I won’t be your target anymore.”</p><p>His voice surprised even him, but the bullies, taken aback, didn’t know how to respond. “What are you going to do about it?” one sneered.</p><p>“I’m going to stand up for myself,” he declared. “And I’m going to help others do the same.”</p><p>Chapter 4: The Change Within As he began to transform his approach, he realized that he didn’t need to retaliate with anger. Instead, he reached out to other students, forming a support group where they could share their experiences and build each other up.</p><p>Days passed, and with each new friendship forged, he felt empowered. No longer did he see himself as a victim; he became a leader among his peers.</p><p>Epilogue: The line between right and wrong shifted as he embraced his role as a champion for others. With each step forward, he taught the bullies a lesson they’d never forget: kindness and resilience are far more powerful than hatred.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",12);function x(I,C){const r=n("font"),s=n("Badge"),h=n("RouteLink"),d=n("center"),l=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return u(),p("div",null,[e("h1",m,[e("a",f,[e("span",null,[t(r,{color:"red"},{default:a(()=>[o("👑 "),b]),_:1}),o(),t(s,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),_,w,e("ul",null,[k,e("li",null,[t(r,{color:"#f46f4e"},{default:a(()=>[o("(Hidden Role) Bard - Has a % Chance of replacing Arrogance.")]),_:1})])]),t(d,null,{default:a(()=>[e("p",null,[t(h,{to:"/options/Impostors/Killing/Bard.html"},{default:a(()=>[t(r,{color:"red"},{default:a(()=>[o("Bard")]),_:1})]),_:1})])]),_:1}),e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[o("From: TOU & Coding: "),e("a",y,[o("KARPED1EM"),t(l)]),o("、"),e("a",v,[o("天寸梦初"),t(l)])])]),e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[t(r,{color:"gray"},{default:a(()=>[o("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),A])])}const S=c(g,[["render",x],["__file","arrogance.html.vue"]]),T=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/arrogance.html","title":"Arrogance","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Arrogance","prev":"/options/Settings/Impostors.html","next":"Bomber"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":null,"contributors":[]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/arrogance.md"}');export{S as comp,T as data};
