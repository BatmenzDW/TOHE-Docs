As his name suggests, he specializes in tracking down targets, acting as the assistant to The Butcher. Equipped with night vision goggles, camo gear, and heat-detecting technology, he’s prepared for any challenge. But he doesn’t just hunt anyone at random; The Butcher provides him with a specific list of crew members and neutrals to target.</p><p>Every successful hunt allows him to take a small bite of his catch, replenishing his cooldown. However, if he mistakenly kills someone not on the list and eats them, his cooldown actually increases—a risky game he plays.</p><p>One day, while delivering some meat to The Mastermind, a conversation unfolded.</p><p>The Mastermind: “Bounty Hunter, right?”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “Yup.”</p><p>The Mastermind: “I’ve heard great things about your work.”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “So?”</p><p>The Mastermind: “This organization could use someone like you for important missions. What do you think?”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “No thanks.”</p><p>The Mastermind: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t dismiss it so quickly.”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “I’ve made up my mind. I’m fine. But if you really need my help, just call. I might be there.”</p><p>With that, he left the conversation hanging.</p><p>Now, with each mission, he continues his relentless pursuit. You can’t run, and you can’t hide. He’s out for blood and flesh—none other than THE Bounty Hunter.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: burgerman7286</p></blockquote>",14);function B(b,H){const n=i("font"),s=i("Badge");return u(),h("div",null,[e("h1",d,[e("a",m,[e("span",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("🎯 "),p]),_:1}),t(),o(s,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),y,g,e("ul",null,[f,e("li",null,[t("Show arrow pointing towards target "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"green"},{default:l(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": the Bounty Hunter will see an arrow of where their target is")]),e("li",null,[o(n,{color:"red"},{default:l(()=>[t("OFF")]),_:1}),t(": the Bounty Hunter will not receive this arrow")])])])]),_,e("details",null,[e("summary",null,[e("b",null,[o(n,{color:"gray"},{default:l(()=>[t("Unofficial Lore")]),_:1})])]),w])])}const T=r(c,[["render",B],["__file","BountyHunter.html.vue"]]),v=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/BountyHunter.html","title":"Bounty Hunter","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Bounty Hunter","prev":"Bomber","next":"Butcher"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1728767165000,"contributors":[{"name":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":5},{"name":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":3}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/BountyHunter.md"}');export{T as comp,v as data};
