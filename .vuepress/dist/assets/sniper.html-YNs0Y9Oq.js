His skills in marksmanship and his imposing presence made him a reliable protector. However, everything changed one fateful evening when a masked intruder, known as the Hangman, infiltrated a public event. In a shocking turn of events, he overpowered the bodyguard and made a deadly move against the superstar, leaving the audience in a state of horror.</p><p>Chapter 1: The Gruesome Life</p><p>The bodyguard had always known his role would be perilous, defending his charge against unseen threats. But after that tragic day, when the Hangman struck, everything shifted. The crowd that once admired him now looked upon him with disdain, casting him aside as a failure. Despite having faced countless dangers, he felt the weight of their disappointment. With wounds both physical and emotional, he found himself in Polus, a rehabilitation facility, where his past achievements felt like distant memories.</p><p>Chapter 2: The Killer Instinct</p><p>In the aftermath of the tragedy, the bodyguard confronted a harsh reality: he had always thrived in the chaos of danger. He had once fought only to protect, but now the anger simmering within him transformed his perspective. The horrific events he had witnessed ignited something deep insideâ€”an urge to reclaim his purpose, even if it meant walking a darker path.</p><p>Chapter 3: At the Doctor&#39;s Office</p><p>During a routine medical check-up, the doctor assessed the years of wear on his body. The scans revealed extensive injuriesâ€”a testament to the sacrifices he had made in service of others. While his body was weakened, his skills with firearms remained sharp, a flicker of hope in a bleak situation.</p><p>Chapter 4: The Bad News</p><p>News of the superstarâ€™s death flooded the media, and the bodyguard became the target of blame. Discussions circulated about his failure to protect his charge, leading to whispers of his impending dismissal. Once a hero, he now found himself isolated, grappling with feelings of betrayal and anger.</p><p>Chapter 5: The Path of Redemption</p><p>In the face of betrayal, the bodyguard realized that he had a choice: to remain a victim or to take control of his fate. Fueled by a desire for justice, he devised a plan to confront those who had turned their backs on him. He set his sights on the crew, determined to expose their negligence and reclaim his honor.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Betrayal can transform the strongest of allies into formidable foes. The Sniper emerged not just as a protector but as a man willing to fight back against those who had wronged him. In the end, his journey was not just about revenge but a quest for redemption and self-discovery.</p><p>The End</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",16);function k(v,S){const i=n("font"),l=n("Badge");return r(),h("div",null,[e("h1",p,[e("a",c,[e("span",null,[a(i,{color:"red"},{default:o(()=>[t("ðŸŽ¯ "),f]),_:1}),t(),a(l,{text:"Killing",type:"tip",vertical:"middle"})])])]),m,g,e("ul",null,[w,b,e("li",null,[t("Precise Shooting: "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[a(i,{color:"green"},{default:o(()=>[t("ON")]),_:1}),t(": this makes Sniper shooting more precise.
