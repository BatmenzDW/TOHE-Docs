Interesting Chapter 1 Never use a Pencil Rumors of a bean who died using a pencil were spreading, Crew all around were horrified and now the paranoia of not using pencils started to rise, Campaigns like "Take the Cil out of Pencil" "Graphite is Smite" began spreading out Chapter 2 A brave bean A brave little bean thought about whether the rumor was actually real or not because if not this would prove the power of Media even in among us It was true but it changed everything later Chapter 3 Now what?!
