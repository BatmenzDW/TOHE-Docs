again</p><p>She was an amazing crewmate and was promoted to be an engineer meaning she could use the vents for her advantage and it really did, because she was highly known to able to finished her task at a high speed, most people sometimes don‚Äôt like her for just finishing her task and doing semi stupid decisions so she could go back into doing it</p><p>But it was gonna be her 1000th streak so she pulled every trick in her book, all of the tips and shortcuts to finished it but because of this she missed some important evidence and information for the impostors like everyone the goes in electrical dies, she didn‚Äôt care she had 3 tasks there and will do anything to do it, then she came face to face with the impostor and while doing her task she got stabbed in the back, she was so close she can‚Äôt die now she must do the task, and she did before she died she completed it and with one more smile she finally died and rest in peace</p><p>The impostors won but while looking at the results of the mission, something was off it says impostors won but at the bottom it also says +Specter, know one knew who was the Specter but all they knew she apparently also won</p><p>Months
