The one who I least expected" The Duel had gone south and the Pursuer was about to die and he was mindlessly babbling words trying to form a melody "Legacy, what is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me Can leave their fingerprints and rise up I'm running out of time, I'm running, and my time's up Wise up, eyes up I catch a glimpse of the other side The Pixie leads a ghost's chorus on the other side" He was going into shock and about to die but then he thought about the tranquility of not thinking about anything at all And as the bullet hit him he flew off into a doze wondering if this was the end...

The Cat survived through storms through diseases through a bullet he couldnt take more and now he just wanted rest and friends who would carry him to a win... A team with gracious people So he joined the Knight but now since the Cat was so weak one more punch or kill he would d!e Well... Everyone has second chances...
