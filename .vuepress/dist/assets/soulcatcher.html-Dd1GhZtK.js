He knew all about crimes and framing people. One day, when he returned home, he saw a note, and on it was written: &quot;We have taken your family. If you want to save them, you have to become evil, dude.&quot; He was shocked, afraid, sad, and some might even say bewildered. He knew family was more important than morals, so what did he do?</p><p>He threw the morals out the window.</p><p>He is now an Impostorâ€”one quite smart, too.</p><p>Before giving up his career for the safety of his crew, he was a scientist gifted with teleportation and swapping.</p><p>He started experimenting with subjects, and soon enough, he could swap himself on the map with another player. Props to him, I guess.</p><p>Now, how could he use this power? For evil, of course. This isn&#39;t some Disney tale; we have to have some bloodshed and people killed, donâ€™t we?</p><p>The Soul Catcher would kill a crew member and then swap himself with another crew, thus framing every single one.</p><p>One day, he was caught. Unfortunately, the target crew was with a friend (more than friends, Iâ€™d say), so he knew what he had to do.</p><p>He went on a rampage, using all his energy to kill the friend. In doing so, his vision decreased, and he could no longer perform any other actions. Thus, the Killing Machine was invented!
