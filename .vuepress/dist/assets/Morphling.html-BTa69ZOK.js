Scared of his surroundings Very Shy and introverted he rarely interacted with people but he was sort of... Good? At killing If we can say that Chapter 1 Lights, Camera, RUN The Morphling was chosen as the lead actor in a school play but well... He just couldnt perform Infront of so many people, Rehearsals were Fine but when he saw the audience... He ran Chapter 2 Well.. Now Mr. Sloth is Known to be kind of..
