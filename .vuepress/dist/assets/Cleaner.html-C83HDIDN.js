Almost cleaner like but wouldn't the cleaner be able to see the role of the impostor then? Curious.. He went on to meet again with the trusty Mad scientist who leads to the development of Impostor roles and asked him about something, The report button working Chapter 2 Just take it out! The cleaner was very germophobic and would never even touch a dead body, It was just kill and kill... But the parasite? It would poke around the body but the cleaner needed to learn this art to use his ability so... Chapter 3 Teach me sensei After years (days) of learning the cleaner finally learnt how to poke around dead bodies and now finally... He could use his ability that he wanted to... Poke around dead bodies and clean them up so he could disarm their report button Chapter 4 After Killing After killing the body the cleaner pressed the report button and started to search for the button and finally he found it and dismantled it, Finally making the body unreportable Chapter 5 But I need to clean this up Thought the Cleaner as he went on to grab a mop and wipe wipe wipe as he cleaned it fully but then he was being treated like a Janitor which made him So overly angry he started to become demented and ate the bodies...
