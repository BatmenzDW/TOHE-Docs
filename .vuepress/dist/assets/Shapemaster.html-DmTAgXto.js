Yes, yes, he would. The tailor began to think of a new idea.</p><p>What if he made costumes that looked like the other crew members? These costumes would be hella fun and easy to use.</p><p>He could easily frame many people‚Äîand in the end, he could win and sabotage the crew.</p><p>The plan was successful, and the Impostors were the last ones standing.</p><p>But then the plan went horribly wrong. There was nothing in the job offer that stated ‚ÄúGuaranteed Death,‚Äù even in victory. Oh man, what could he do now?</p><p>The ship was crashing, and the other Impostors just closed their eyes and accepted their fate.
