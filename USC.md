# <font color=#f0b6d5>User Submitted Content</font>

This page acts as a hub for all User Submitted Content!

User Submitted Content consists of:

1. <font color=#ebd326>Custom Translations:</font> These change the display names for roles and just about anything else.

2. <font color=#142cd9>Custom Presets:</font> Hosts can share their settings for others to use as well!

3. <font color=#f0b6d5>More to come:</font> We currently only have Translations + Presets, no real clue what else we'd have though!
