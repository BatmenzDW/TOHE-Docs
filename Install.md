* Visit `#mod-release` in TEN's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ten), or go [here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest) to download it directly from GitHub. 

Installation requires that you own a PC version of Among Us on Steam, Epic, Xbox App, or Itch. Microsoft Store will not work.

<summary><b><font color=gray>Install Town of Host: Enhanced for</font> <font color=#14356a>Steam</font></b></summary>

Notice: You can follow the installation video [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyD75caFQ0) if you want visuals with steps. However, the below steps work just fine.

1. Download the latest full Release of Town of Host: Enhanced in `#mod-release` or [here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest). You only need the main zip such as "`TOHE.v1.0.0.zip`", not the source code files. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE `-MS` FILE, IT WILL NOT WORK!

2. Once the download is complete, unzip it into a new empty folder like on desktop.

3. Locate your AmongUs install. For example, if you own the game on Steam, you can find this by right clicking on the game in your library, selecting "Manage", and finally selecting "Browse local files."<br>

4. Select all of the files in your Among Us installation and copy them to the folder that now has the files from the TOHE release. The folder should now look something like this:<br>
![image](./images/ResultFolder.png)

5. Within the TOHE folder, run `Among Us.exe`. The first time running it may take some time while the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.<br>
Note: If you separated your TOHE Mod and Vanilla folders, and run into an issue where it says 'you are logged out/in offline mode', close TOHE and open Steam (or launch Vanilla AU as this will open Steam too), then try again. This should solve the issue. (Separating your folders isn't required, but recommended so your mod still works if a major Among Us update is released.)

6. `(Optional)` Right click your `Among Us.exe` and click '`Create shortcut`'. Move your new shortcut to wherever you can easily access it, such as your Desktop!
#### You have now installed Town of Host: Enhanced! All that remains is to start up a private lobby and customize your settings.

<summary><b><font color=gray>Install Town of Host: Enhanced for</font> <font color=#343434>Epic Games</font></b></summary>

1. Download the latest full Release of Town of Host: Enhanced in `#mod-release` or [here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest). You only need the main zip such as "`TOHE.v1.0.0.zip`", not the source code files. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE `-MS` FILE, IT WILL NOT WORK!

2. Once the download is complete, unzip it into a new empty folder somewhere like on desktop.

3. Locate your AmongUs install. Find Among Us and click on the 3 dots `...` > click the folder icon button on the installation bar.<br>
![image](./images/EpicInstallation.png)

4. Select all of the files in your TOHE folder and copy them to the Among Us installation folder. The folder should now look something like this:<br>
![image](./images/EpicFiles.png)

5. Within the Among Us folder, run `EpicGamesStarter.exe` ([Download Here](https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesStarter/releases/tag/1.0.2) & Follow instructions on page.) The first time running it may take some time while installing a prerequisite and the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen or a console window, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.<br>
Note: Unlike Steam, you shouldn't run into the 'you are logged out/in offline mode' issue as TOHE has to be in your Epic Games folder and cannot be separated. You can play Vanilla as usual by clicking the Settings Wheel in the top-right of the window, and swapping to Vanilla.

6. Add the folder you put the mod and among us files in as a exclusion for any antivirus you have and windows defender.

7. `(Optional)` Right click your `EpicGamesStarter.exe` and click '`Create shortcut`'. Move your new shortcut to wherever you can easily access it, such as your Desktop!

<summary><b><font color=gray>Install Town of Host: Enhanced for</font> <font color=#0e7a0d>Xbox App</font></b></summary>

1. Download the latest full Release of Town of Host: Enhanced [here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest). You only need the other zip such as "`TOHE.v1.0.0-MS.zip`", not the source code files. MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE `-MS` FILE, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!<br>

2. Once the download is complete, unzip it into a new empty folder like on desktop.

3. Locate your AmongUs install. Firstly you need to go to Xbox App, then you can find this by right clicking on the game in your Library, selecting "Manage", then "Files", and finally selecting "Browse files".<br>

4. Select all of the files in your TOHE folder and copy them to the Among Us installation folder. The folder should now look something like this:<br>
![image](./images/MSResultFolder.png)

5. Now go back to Xbox App, then launch the game like you would normally do. Theres no problem in launching the game with `Among Us.exe` at all.<br>
Note: Like Epic Games, you shouldn't run into the 'you are logged out/in offline mode' issue as TOHE has to be in your Xbox App folder and cannot be separated. You can play Vanilla as usual by clicking the Settings Wheel in the top-right of the window, and swapping to Vanilla.<br><br>

NOTE: This is for the `Xbox App` version of Among Us. You cannot download TOHE on the Microsoft Store version of Among Us. TOHE cannot be downloaded on Xbox Consoles.

<summary><b><font color=gray>Install Town of Host: Enhanced for</font> <font color=#3004fc>Mod Manager</font></b></summary>

1. Download the [Mod Manager 7](https://goodloss.fr/mm/) installer.

2. Once the download is complete, open the installer and click install. You can change the destination if you want, but that's not required. Once Mod Manager is installed, close the installer (delete it if you'd like) and open Mod Manager (There should be an icon on your desktop, if not then check around in AppData).

3. `(Notice)` If you get a notification like this upon opening Mod Manager, re-install Among Us fully.<br>
![image](./images/ModManagerFail.png)

4. Once you open Mod Manager, swap your search category to `Active Mods`. Search the page for Town of Host: Enhanced. Click the download icon on the TOHE box, and wait for it to download. Once it downloads, head to your Mods Library and start TOHE.

#### You have now installed Town of Host: Enhanced! All that remains is to start up a private lobby and customize your settings.

<summary><b><font color=gray>Installing <font color=#ebd326>Presets</font></font></b></summary>

You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. 

For some Member Submitted Presets, visit [This Page](/Presets.html).

1. If you want to use a preset, make sure the file is renamed to `Options.json` before using it, if it isn't already. (If you do not have `File name extensions` marked on the `View` Tab, you only need to rename it to `Options`.)

2. You have to put the file in the following directory: `.\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData` for it to work. (If you cannot locate `TOHE-DATA\SaveData`, try enabling `Hidden items` on the `View` Tab!)

3. `(Note)` If you download a preset that is from a version newer than that one which you are running on, it will still work, but any settings in the preset you downloaded that aren't already in the version you are on will be ignored.

4. `(Keep in Mind)`: It is always suggested to just roll with whatever you like! If you see any roles you may like or are simply interested in, enable them, and mess with them to your personal liking!
