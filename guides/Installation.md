# <font color=#f0b6d5>Guide to Town of Host: Enhanced - <font color=#ed3d52>Installation</font></font>

Now that you’re familiar with Town of Host: Enhanced (TOHE) and its exciting features, it’s time to get the mod installed and start playing!<br>
Don’t worry—this guide will walk you through every step, ensuring a smooth installation so you can jump straight into the action.

### <font color=#f0b6d5>Before  Installation:</font>
Make sure you have the following ready:

1. A Working PC or Laptop. (Among Us is on many platforms such as Mobile Devices, Consoles, & PC. You can only install mods on PC/Computer. If you don't have a PC, it's alright because you can still join Host-Only mods as long as you have Among Us on any device!)

2. Among Us paid for & installed on your computer. (Note: Pirated Versions of Among Us will <b>NOT</b> work for TOHE, nor do we condone pirated editions of the game.)

3. Any Browser such as Google, Opera, Firefox, and so on. (Any browser should work just fine!)

4. A little bit of spare time. (This can take a bit if you are brand new, but don't worry about it!)

Note: Make sure that you install the proper files during Installation. `TOHE.dll` is meant for updating if you've already installed the mod (More on that later), TOHE's Source Code will not work at all.

### <font color=#f0b6d5>Step 0: Decide what Game Platform you want TOHE on</font>

Make sure you click on the right page of your platform for more Installation Steps, as these can vary by the smallest bits depending on the platform.

Itch is not included, as that just gives you a Steam Key to purchase Among Us on Steam.
