# <font color=#f0b6d5>Installation Guide to TOHE on: <font color=#0e7a0d>Xbox App</font></font>

It appears you want to install TOHE on Xbox App! Lucky for you, you're in the right place.<br>
Follow these simple steps, and TOHE will be working in no-time at all!

NOTE: This is for the `Xbox App` version of Among Us. You cannot download TOHE on the Microsoft Store version of Among Us. TOHE cannot be downloaded on Xbox Consoles.

### <font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#0e7a0d>Step 1:</font> Download the Latest Release</font>

Download the latest full Release of Town of Host: Enhanced in our Discord at `#tohe-release`, or on our GitHub [Here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest). (Make sure you install the `TOH-Enhanced-XboxApp-2.2.0.zip` & not `TOH-Enhanced-SteamEpic-2.2.0.zip`.)

### <font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#0e7a0d>Step 2:</font> Extract the Mod Folder</font>

Once the download is complete, extract it into a new empty folder somewhere, like on the desktop.

### <font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#0e7a0d>Step 3:</font> Copy + Paste your Mod Files into Game Directory</font>

Locate your AmongUs install. Firstly you need to go to Xbox App, then you can find this by right clicking on the game in your Library, selecting <i>Manage</i>, then <i>Files</i>, and finally selecting <i>Browse files</i>.<br>

### <font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#0e7a0d>Step 4:</font> Run Among Us to Set Up the Mod</font>

Now go back to Xbox App, then launch the game like you would normally do. Theres no problem in launching the game with <i>Among Us.exe</i> at all.<br>
Note: You shouldn't run into the 'you are logged out/in offline mode' issue as TOHE <i>has</i> to be in your Xbox App folder and cannot be separated. You can play Vanilla as usual by clicking the Settings Wheel in the top-right of the window, and swapping to Vanilla.

### <font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#0e7a0d>Step 5:</font> Create a Shortcut <font color=#ed3d52>[OPTIONAL]</font></font>

Right click your <i>Among Us.exe</i> file and click <i>Create shortcut</i>. Then, move the new shortcut to a location thatâ€™s easy for you to access, such as your Desktop.
