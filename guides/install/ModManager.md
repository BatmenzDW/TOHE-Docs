# <font color=#f0b6d5>Installation Guide to TOHE on: <font color=#3004fc>Mod Manager</font></font>

(Hey! Mod Manager is <i>currently</i> out of commission at this point in time. Sorry for the inconvenience.)

### <font color=#3004fc>Step 1: Download and Install Mod Manager</font>

Download the [Mod Manager 7](https://goodloss.fr/mm/) installer.
Once the download is complete, open the installer and click <i>install</i>. You can change the destination if you want, but that's not required. Once Mod Manager is installed, close the installer (delete it if you'd like) and open Mod Manager (There should be an icon on your desktop, if not then check around in AppData).

### <font color=#3004fc>Step 2: Verify Among Us Installation</font>

`(Notice)` If you get a notification like this upon opening Mod Manager, re-install Among Us fully.<br>

### <font color=#3004fc>Step 4: Launch TOHE</font>

Once it downloads, head to your <i>Mods Library</i> and start TOHE.
