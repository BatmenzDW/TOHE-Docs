# <font color=#f0b6d5>Installation Guide to TOHE on: <font color=#343434>Epic Games</font></font>

It appears you want to install TOHE on Epic Games! Lucky for you, you're in the right place.<br>
Follow these simple steps, and TOHE will be working in no-time at all!

Notice: You can follow the installation video [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyD75caFQ0) if you want visuals with steps. However, the below steps work just fine.

### <font color=#343434>Step 1: Download the Latest Release</font>

Download the latest full Release of Town of Host: Enhanced in our Discord at `#tohe-release`, or on our GitHub [Here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest). (Make sure you install the `TOH-Enhanced-SteamEpic-2.2.0.zip` & not `TOH-Enhanced-XboxApp-2.2.0.zip`.)

### <font color=#343434>Step 2: Extract the Mod Folder</font>

Once the download is complete, extract it into a new empty folder somewhere, like on the desktop.

### <font color=#343434>Step 3: Copy + Paste your Mod Files into Game Directory</font>

Locate your AmongUs install. Find Among Us and click on the 3 dots `...` > click the folder icon button on the installation bar.<br>

Select all of the files in your TOHE folder and copy them over to the Among Us installation folder. The folder should now look something like this:<br>

### <font color=#343434>Step 4: Run EpicGamesStarter to Set Up the Mod</font>

Firstly, download [EpicGamesStarter](https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesStarter/releases/tag/1.0.2), wait for the install, then place the .exe file from the ZIP folder into your Among Us directory and run it.<br>
The first time running it may take a bit while installing a prerequisite and the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen or a console window, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.<br>
Note: Unlike Steam, you shouldn't run into the 'you are logged out/in offline mode' issue as TOHE has to be in your Epic Games folder and cannot be separated. You can play Vanilla as usual by clicking the Settings Wheel in the top-right of the window, and swapping to Vanilla.

### <font color=#343434>Step 5: Whitelist TOHE</font>

To prevent any interference from your antivirus or Windows Defender, add the folder containing the TOHE and Among Us files to the exclusion list of both your antivirus software and Windows Defender.

### <font color=#343434>Step 6: Create a Shortcut [OPTIONAL]</font>

Right click your <i>EpicGamesStarter.exe</i> file and click <i>Create shortcut</i>. Then, move the new shortcut to a location thatâ€™s easy for you to access, such as your Desktop.

### You have now installed Town of Host: Enhanced on Epic Games! Now, it's time to Set-Up TOHE!
