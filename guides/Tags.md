# <font color=#f0b6d5>Guide to Town of Host: Enhanced - <font color=#3dedac>Tags</font></font>

Open the root directory of the mod and find the `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\Tags` folder to get started!

This folder holds 4 files (by default), 3 Folders (`MOD_TAGS` + `VIP_TAGS`, + `SPONSOR_TAGS`), & a `Tag_Template.txt` file.<br>
You can disregard the 3 folders as those use a separate system of Tags, the new system utilizes the `Tag_Template.txt` file.<br>

When you open the Tag Template, you'll see some lines to fill out, first Copy the Tag Template so things are easier (The mod will automatically generate a new one if you've lost it), then you can fill this out however you want to give a user a Custom Tag.<br>
You can leave most of it blank for a default tag (display) or edit the other lines with info for specific permissions. The file explains it clear enough, so use that.<br>
Once you've filled out the file, you can rename it to the friendcode of the player you want to have the Tag (Like friendcode#1234) and you're set.<br>

If you'd like to sort your friend codes into custom folders, you may, and it will automatically be checked AS LONG AS it's in the Tags directory. (Note: Don't name the folders any of the following: `MOD_TAGS`, `VIP_TAGS`, & `SPONSOR_TAGS`, as those use the old Tag System.)

### Now that you've how Tags work, we can check out other Gamemodes!
