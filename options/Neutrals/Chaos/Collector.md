After the Collector votes for a target, they will collect all the votes cast onto that target in the meeting. When the Collector collects the specified number of votes, the Collector wins. Note: Collector wins take precedence over exile players.
* Max
  * Set the Maximum amount of Collectors that can be in a match
* Required number of votes
  * Set the amount of Votes a Collector needs to receive to Win

The collector got in a deal with The mastermind
If the collector could supply a specific number of voted to the mastermind then he could persuade the game master to let them win
But then due to "Natural Causes"
The Mastermind died as soon as he told the collector this strategy

Now the collector was known to be quite a nerd.
He would go on developing amazing ways of stealing items and collecting them basically

He invented a machined to record finger prints and the more times he would record them the more he could collect

And this worked fine
But then he had an idea what if he replicated his own finger prints?

Well turns out

He burnt his fingers once and lost fingerprints 

Well he can still win if 15 or more people recored finger prints but how?

Well duplication is fine but this tool is so expensive so what if he just...
Put this in the system recording votes of anyone person...

Then he got his voted
14/15...

What now? It's only 4 people left and 1 killer..
What if he said one of the killers was his medic and Hard cleared him... and self reported?

Amazing idea...
And due to this He died...

But the game master was able to make this loss turn to a win!

Wow... mastermind really lost a good way of winning due to "Natural Causes"
