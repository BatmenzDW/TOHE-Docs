Now the god was not actually god‚Ä¶
Pretty confusing right?
Well if he was god he would just win every game..
Which he did not‚Ä¶
He had successful games but losses to

Now when he died by the serial killer it was his last life‚Ä¶
Now he saw God and he asked..
Where did I go wrong
‚ÄúNo where‚Äù
So how could he redeem himself?

Well by being a missionary and carrying the idea of peace and no violence to the beans..
Bu being their god..

But by doing that god also gave him powers to steal wins and know roles..
But the catch? He can‚Äôt kill
He can‚Äôt guess
Only forced to kill‚Ä¶

Well the crew mates found it extremely irritating for god stealing their wins
They tried to find god

Now god was very‚Ä¶ overwhelmed by the spotlight so he kept announcing in every meeting there was a god to remove some of the blames from him
But now he was accused

And ejected
And he died

No second chances‚Ä¶

The end!
