"The More I work The More Luck I Gain"
The workaholic was known to be a big... BIG gambler but he believed as a superstition that he would become Extra lucky and win more if he worked more

Brilliant I guess...
The crew feared him... If he had no more work he would just make a bet with Mr. Sloth and win... And this win will make them

Loose.

So they assigned him more and MORE tasks..
But he kept speeding to them and doing them

"Tie him up"
"But sir... isn't that unfair"
"DO IT"

And they tied him up... Resisting he broke away but the Impostor stabbed him...

"What did you do" YELLED the captain

"Where.. am I"
You're in heaven buddy.. Told the medium..
"Just kidding you're a ghost!"

Complete your tasks to win!
As the Workaholic remembered his goal he rushed...
And flipped the right energy in shields...
Turning them on..

He... did it..
No more tasks..
Marching to the office of Mr. Sloth he bet him that he would win Russian roulette..
Being fearful Mr. Sloth denied.

And the workaholic was given command of the Skeld...
He crashed it.

The End
