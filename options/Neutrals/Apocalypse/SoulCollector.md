As Soul Collector, you can use your kill button on a player to predict their death. You will gain a soul if your target dies in the round you select them or the meeting after.<br>
Your target resets after each meeting or after they die, whichever comes first.<br>
Once you collect the configurable amount of souls, you become Death. If the gain passive souls setting is enabled, you will gain a soul each meeting.
