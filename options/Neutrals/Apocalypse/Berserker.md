As the Berserker, you level up with each kill. Upon reaching a certain level defined by the host, you unlock a new power.<br>
Scavenged kills make your kills disappear.<br>
Bombed kills make your kills explode. Be careful when killing, as this can kill your other Apocalypse members if they are near.<br>
After a certain level you become War.
