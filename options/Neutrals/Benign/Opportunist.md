- Stay Alive...
Staying alive is hard.. 
Even harder when you are surrounded by murderers.. Then you have to be one..

The opportunist thought this before well 
The Incident

After her best friend The Maverick was MURDERED in cold blood by the Last Impostor to take revenge.. The opportunist was shook

One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine
There are ten things you need to know (number one!)
This world was wide enough for everyone but no one...
Her friend fiddled with the Trigger
The Impostor was a terrible shot
The Maverick was wearing glasses.. To take deadly aim
The Impostor doing everything to live
The Maverick drew first Position
There was no beat No Melody
They were near the same spot The Shaman died
Examining the terrain....

Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count (one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine, number-ten paces, fire!)

And... It all ended... His final words were...
My love Opportunist take your time...
Wait Love?...
"He Loved me?"

And that moment she went crazy and started laughing from shock for More than an hour and when finally she calmed down she realized..
She had to tell the Maverick's story....

She had to live and tell his story...

She had to tell the Shaman's story and how people just wanted to live...

But in the end...

"You have no control over Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?"
-Shaman

When you are gone... who keeps your flame..
Who tells your story...

And the Opportunist Lives another 50 years and interviews the companions.. She tells their story...

She... lives

The.... End
