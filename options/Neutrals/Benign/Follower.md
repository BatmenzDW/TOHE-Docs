- Non-Stop
The Follower was just roaming in the streets when he saw the advertisement for job as the partner of the Pixie

Flashback
Ever since he was under the leadership of The Mastermind he was helpless he did not know how to make decisions on his own and proceed further in life He just wanted a mentor and he found one

Back to reality
The Pixie did not offer money only a guarantee to chaos and bloodshed...
An endless cycle of tasks repeated by them to win

The pixie would tag them and bag them while the follower will Follow The tagged ones around and find dirt on them

And Man, The Man was Non-Stop
After the pixie retired the Follower was still YoungIsh And wanted to Pursue His dreams

The follower thus started following different teams different games and winning with them His only goal was to stay alive

And then after the games when the chaos ended and he wanted a break... he just wanted to live and since he was the student of the sheriff and the quick firer once he knew a new skill..

Making others misfire...

And so was the story of the follower who got tired of intruding that he became the Pursuer...
Just trying to live

But... The retired pixie warned him 
"Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom"


And this Warning? Proved to be true soon...
