As Schrodingers Cat, if someone attempts to use the kill button on you, you will block the action and join their team. This blocking ability works only once. By default, you don't have a victory condition, meaning you win only after switching teams.<br>
In Addition to this, you will be counted as nothing in the game.<br><br>

Note: If the killing machine attempts to use their kill button on you, the interaction is not blocked, and you will die.
* Max
  * Set the Maximum amount of Schrodinger Cats that can be in a match
