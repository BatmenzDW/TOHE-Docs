As the Glitch, you are a glitch in the ship with the goal of killing everyone.<br>
You can hack players, which prevents them from killing, venting and reporting dead bodies for some time.<br><br>
Single click - Hack<br>
Double click - Kill<br>
You can use the sabotage map and call a sabotage (not doors) to disguise as a random player for a limited time. (The sabotage won't actually occur. This means you cannot disguise during and after sabotages, due to technical difficulties.)<br>
You have to kill <b>everyone</b> to win.
