Only the Demon team and the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> team are left, and the number of Demon is greater than the number of <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> members, then the Demon win. The Demon's killing rules are different from others. Everyone in the Demon's perspective has health volume. Demon kill and are killed instead consume health. Killing will take effect when the health is exhausted. Note: If other people consume the Demon's health but fail to kill the player, the murderer will see the shield-animation on the Demon as a reminder.
