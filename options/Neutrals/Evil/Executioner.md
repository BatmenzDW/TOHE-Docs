"Another beautiful Morning to chop off some heads eh chap?" Declared the executioner to his fellow comrades as he picked up his scythe.
And then his pale faced, Green eyed friend came funning through the door with a knife stuck in his back
The executioner screamed "NOO Who did this Agamemnon do you know?"
"A- Aeg- Aegisthus"
"Don't you dare leave me here Just stay awake."
But to no use, Agamemnon stopped breathing..

The whole day the Executioner was bawling and he refused to talk to anyone.
He had one goal in his mind though. Revenge.

As the dark dusty dawn shed light on the poorly lit room of the Executioner, A fire was lit in his eyes. He would stop at nothing to get back at Aegisthus.
The game has just gone afoot.

As the days went by the Executioner kept tip-toeing around Aegisthus' room trying to find some incriminating evidence. And it was a fortnight later that he was informed of the secret plan of Aegisthus to dethrone Ulysseus.

Now that he knew he could get the blonde, Blue eyed brilliant ruler of Ithaca behind his back? He would be unstoppable

Now the main plan comes to life.
Get everyone to believe The Executioners' story

And so he went. Exaggerating all the events and getting people to sympathise with him.
It was truly a great day to be him.

And then Aegisthus was executed by the hands of the executioner... Poetic truly

The executioner wins by getting revenge!!
"All of this took so much work that I might just collapse" 

And the executioner became unconscious
