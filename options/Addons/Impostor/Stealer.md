Only <font color=red>Impostor</font> other than Bombers and Trapsters will become Stealer. Every time a Stealer kills a person, he gets an additional vote (the vote number is set by the host, and the decimal is rounded down). Also, extra votes from the Stealer are hidden during meeting.
* Max
  * Set the Maximum amount of Stealers that can be in a match.
* Spawn Chance
  * Set the percentage players have of getting Stealer.
* Votes Increase Amount Per Kill
  * Set how much the Stealers votes increase after a kill.
