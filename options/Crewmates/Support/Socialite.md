The Socialite may use their kill button on a player to "throw a party" on that player for the round. 
* Anyone who attempts to interact with the partied player will be denied that round and will be notified that there was a party on that player. 
* These rejected players will be added to a "Guest List", which the Socialite will be notified of during the next meeting. 
* Everyone on the Guest List will now be able to interact with any player the Socialite parties with. 

The Socialite may also vote a player during a meeting to add that player to the Guest List. Players can not be removed from the Guest List.
