* Bodies the Coroner uses can‚Äôt be reported
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: any body that the Coroner interacts with cannot be reported
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the body that a Coroner interacts with can still be reported
* Initial Ability Use Limit
  * Set the amount of Ability Uses a Coroner has at the start of the game
* <font color=#00ffff>Amount of Ability</font> <font color=#7fffd2>Use Gains</font> <font color=#00ffff>with Each Task Completed</font>
