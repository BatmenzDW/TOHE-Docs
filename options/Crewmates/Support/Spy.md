As the Spy, when someone uses their kill button on you (any ability that is used through the kill button), you'll see their name in orange for a few seconds.<br>
Note: If a Crewmate used their ability on you, you'll also see them with an orange name!<br>
Note: If you have no ability uses left, you won't see orange names at all!<br>
Note: If the kill button interaction is blocked the player's cooldown will reset to 10s
