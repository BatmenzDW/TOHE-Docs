The Judge can judge a certain player during the Meeting. 

If the Target is evil, the Target will be killed. If the Judge is wrong and the Target isn‚Äôt evil, the Judge will Suicide. 

The judging command is `/tl [player ID]`.

You can see the ID of player‚Äôs next to their name, or by typing `/id`

PS: You don‚Äôt need to worry about this if you have a TOHE Modded Client, as it includes a built-in Trial Button on Player Nameplates.
