This page is a copy of Sunnyboy, this should be finished so adding this text is useless if it wont appear in the finished product. If it does, I forgot somehow. Everything is prepped MINUS this page.

* You must have “Disable Hidden Roles” toggled <font color=red>OFF</font> for this to have a chance to appear
* Despite being listed under Evil, this role is actually Benign. It is only listed as Evil due to Jester being an Evil role.
