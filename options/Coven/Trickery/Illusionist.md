The Illusionist can use their kill button on a player to reverse the results of any investigative role. For example, if someone with a kill button is Illusioned, they will appear not to have a kill button to the Investigator, and vice versa.<br>Depending on the host's settings, Illusions wear off after meetings.<br><b>With the Necronomicon, you may double-click to kill. Every kill you make appears as a random death reason.</b>
