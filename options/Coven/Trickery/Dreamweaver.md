The Dreamweaver can dreamweave a player. The dreamwoven players will be notified of this during the next meeting. If the Dreamweaver is not voted out, these players be driven to insomnia and will be unable to use their abilities, and their votes will not count until the
Dreamweaver dies.
With the Necronomicon, the Dreamweaver can double-click to kill.
