The Hex Master can use their kill button to mark a player with the 乂 symbol. If a player has this at the end of the meeting and the Hex Master hasn't died - then they die.<br><b>With the Necronomicon, the hex will be passed around - similar to an agitator bomb. Also, you can double-click the kill button to kill normally.</b>
