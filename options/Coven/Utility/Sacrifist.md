The Sacrifist can click the shapeshift button to cause a random debuff to a non-coven member, however, the Sacrifist will also receive this effect (when applicable).<br>The random player will be the same player until the round ends.<br>Depending on the hostâ€™s settings, if the Sacrifist is voted out, some random non-coven who voted the Sacrifist will die too.<br>Normally, the Sacrifist can not kill, however, to prevent prolonging of the game, Sacrifist can kill if they are the last Coven member alive.<br><b>With the Necronomicon, when you shapeshift, you will commit the Ultimate Sacrifice. When you do this, you die. However, the entire Coven receives a lowered kill cooldown for the rest of the game.</b>
