As the Double Agent, you do not have access to the kill button, but you can vote someone in a meeting to pass a bomb onto them. This can only be done one player at a time. Once the meeting has finished the bomb will activate and explode in a set amount of time.
Note that when you pass the bomb onto someone in a meeting you will be able to vote afterwards.
Additionally depending on settings the Double Agent can diffuse Bastion and Agitator bombs when venting.
