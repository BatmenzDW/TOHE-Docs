Prologue The Kamikaze was a very smart engineer who was veryâ€¦ Gifted in making veryâ€¦ Specific? (If that explains it) technology but he doesnâ€™t have the will to liveâ€¦ Chapter 1 School While in school the Kamikaze was often inspired by even the smallest inventions likeâ€¦ Door Handles, Locks, Microwaves, etc Not Atom accelerators not laptopsâ€¦ But he knew if he could decode these simple amenities he could easily figure out the big bombsâ€¦ Chapter 2 Trusty Screwdriver Everywhere he would go he would roam with his trusty screwdriver and open any technology even televisions and try to put them back togetherâ€¦ This was very dangerous for normalâ€¦ Average humans but not for himâ€¦ One day though it all will change Chapter 3 Atoms So Let me brief it.. He found that there is a specific element called Odysseusinum which can be triggered by heat and can perform chain reactions to do specific events in a specific order and wellâ€¦ This gave Kamikaze an Ideaâ€¦ Chapter 4 Iâ€™m an Impostor? No surprise Kamikaze already knew he would become an Impostor no new news there but how will he utilise thisâ€¦ well.. He could plant bombs on everyoneâ€™s body since he was very swift with his movement he could do itâ€¦ Chapter 5 What now? Since his bombs are powered by Odysseusinum so he needed to heat at least a VERY LARGE amount of Odysseusinum but they would evaporate mid air if he dropped It into the lava soâ€¦ He had to drop with themâ€¦ Great!! Chapter 6 You all are fools! As the Kamikaze was thrown into the lava by the crewmates as he faked a task he started a chain reaction and all the crewmates with bombs utilizing Odysseusinum were BLOWN up and diedâ€¦ Mass Murder 101! The End? Of course! There's no coming back from lava Duh
