The Evil Guesser can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting. 

If it is correct, the target dies, and if it is wrong, the Evil Guesser dies. 

The guessing command is `/bt [player ID] [Role]`.<br>
You can see the ID of player‚Äôs next to their name, or by typing `/id`<br>
Note: You don‚Äôt need to worry about this if you have a TOHE Modded Client, as it includes a built-in Guesser GUI on Player Nameplates

Prologue

‚ÄúSAY SOMETHING!‚Äù shouted the Romantic. ‚ÄúNOOO!‚Äù came the response as the bean was declared dead. ‚ÄúH‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶was JUST alive during the meeting!‚Äù

Chapter 1: A New Opportunity

‚ÄúAnother wonderful day,‚Äù Sherlock said to himself, sipping coffee while scanning the newspaper. His eyes landed on a headline: ‚ÄúHiring Detectives and Sleuths.‚Äù This could change everything for him.

Chapter 2: Back to HQ

‚ÄúAh, HQ. Brings back memories,‚Äù Sherlock thought as he entered the familiar space for his first game. While completing tasks, he stumbled upon a lifeless body. He examined it closely for clues and noticed distinct handprints. This discovery could lead him to the truth.

Chapter 3: The Accusation

Sherlock rushed to the lobby to share his findings. ‚ÄúI know who the killer is: John is Hangman.‚Äù Overcome with guilt, John felt he had no way out and took drastic action. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs that,‚Äù Sherlock said, feeling the weight of his words.

Chapter 4: Another Target

During the next meeting, Sherlock made another bold claim. ‚ÄúI think Joe is the captain, based on his hands.‚Äù Unfortunately, this led to another innocent being ejected. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another good person gone,‚Äù he thought, regret flooding in.

Chapter 5: A Descent into Darkness

‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù Sherlock whispered, looking at the metaphorical stains on his hands. As meetings continued, he felt a growing thrill from manipulating the game, unable to resist the urge to play the part of the deceiver.

Chapter 6: A New Identity

The Godfather watched Sherlock's transformation with interest. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve shown great skill, my friend,‚Äù he said, recognizing Sherlock‚Äôs potential.

‚ÄúWhat name will you go by now?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Sherlock replied, grappling with his new persona.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give you a title that fits. How about ‚ÄòThe Evil Guesser‚Äô?‚Äù

Sherlock smiled, feeling a surge of confidence. ‚ÄúI like that.‚Äù

Embracing his new identity, he delved deeper into deception, crafting elaborate schemes that left others in disarray. He eventually got admired and took out his team one by one.
