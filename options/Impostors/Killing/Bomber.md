Prologue:
“Fine day!” muttered the Engineer as he meticulously checked for any signs of sabotage. He had recently been transported to Mira HQ, where Mr. Sloth had established the new headquarters. His task was simple: ensure everything was operational before the crewmates settled on the planet. The headquarters boasted one major feature—a fully functional nuclear reactor. However, the day was about to take a dark turn.

Chapter 1: A Sudden Disaster
“Why am I always stuck doing this?” grumbled the Engineer as he wandered through the expansive facility. Just as he began to lose himself in thought, a loud BOOM echoed through the halls. The reactor had exploded, claiming the lives of his fellow engineers. Fortunately, he had been far enough away to escape the initial blast, but he wouldn’t escape the repercussions.

Chapter 2: The Checkup
After the incident, he made his way to the infirmary for a checkup.
Doctor: “I’m surprised you even survived the radiation!”
Engineer: “How long do I have left?”
Doctor: “2 to 3 months, max.”

Chapter 3: A Dark Offer
That’s when Moriarty, the Mastermind, entered the scene. He offered the Engineer a deal: financial support for his family in exchange for every crewmate he eliminated—and even more if he took out Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective. Moriarty’s manipulative words began to sink in.

The Engineer thought, I’ve done so much for them, yet they don’t acknowledge me! The explosion… An idea began to form in his mind: he could become a Bomber.

Chapter 4: The Plan Unfolds
Determined to make his mark, he gathered everyone together under the pretense of a meeting. As the crewmates congregated, he prepared to unleash chaos. With a heart full of anger and a plan in mind, he struck.

Chapter 5: The Boom
Just as the meeting commenced, he detonated his hidden explosives. The blast consumed everyone in the room, taking them down with him. The final moments were a whirlwind of emotions—sadness, terror, and a strange sense of vindication.

Epilogue: New Powers
In the aftermath, from a distant universe, Dr. Moe and Mr. Sloth observed the turmoil within Among Us. They contemplated the fate of the Engineer turned Bomber. Seeing his potential, they granted him new powers: armor to protect him from self-destruction, abilities to shield impostors from his explosive wrath, and more.

What lay ahead for the Bomber was uncertain, but one thing was clear: his legacy had only just begun.
