Prologue

The little bean was known for his cunning and skill in forging equipment. He had attended every type of engineering school and excelled in all.

Chapter 1: The Idol

The Quick Shooter was fascinated by Greek mythology, especially the tale of Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship. He admired how Hephaestus forged remarkable creations with precision and artistry, drawing inspiration from his legendary skills.

Chapter 2: The Impostor's Journey

Every day, The Quick Shooter honed his forging abilities, growing faster and more adept. When Mr. Sloth selected him to be the impostor, he was thrilled! He had devised a meticulous strategy that he believed was unbeatable‚Äîa clever plan to exploit the kill cooldown and energy usage.

Chapter 3: The Strategy in Action

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to put my skills to the test!‚Äù he thought. Inspired by Hephaestus, he crafted bullets with astonishing speed, able to forge them while walking in just 20-30 seconds. He carried a toolbelt to store his creations, ready to implement his plan.

Chapter 4: Rampage Time

With his new abilities, he unleashed chaos. He shot his way through the game, using his trusty gun and the forged bullets to bypass his kill cooldown. It felt like a miracle, just as Hephaestus would have created!

Chapter 5: The Drawback

However, there was a catch. His bullets were quite heavy, and during meetings, he had to drop some to avoid being weighed down. This limitation meant he could only carry a small number of bullets at a time, forcing him to strategize carefully.

Chapter 6: Making the Mentor Proud

The Quick Shooter skillfully faked tasks while cleverly forging new bullets, all while earning the crew‚Äôs trust. In the final round, just after the meeting, he found himself with three bullets and three remaining crewmates. With a smirk, he took aim and‚Äîbang! Everyone fell.

From Olympus, Hephaestus smiled down, proud of his eager apprentice.
