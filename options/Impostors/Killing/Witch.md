The Witch has two attack methods: Direct Killing & Spelling. Pressing the Kill button twice (Depending on Switch Method) will result in a normal kill. Pressing the Kill button once will cast a spell on the Witchâ€™s target. During the Meeting, the Witch's target(s) will have a symbol next to their name (A cross) indicating that they were Spelled. If the Witch is not ejected/guessed by the end of the meeting, all of their targets will die when the Meeting concludes.

The Witch was an outcast from the very beginning. While the other crewmates laughed and socialized on the ship, she preferred to immerse herself in books and study, even during her free time. Constantly mocked for her social skillsâ€”or lack thereofâ€”her genuine attempts to connect with others fell flat. Frustrated with being the target of jokes, she decided it was time to stand up for herself.

One day, she stormed into the cafeteria and demanded an apology from the crew. "Just because I'm different doesn't mean I have to change to fit in!" she shouted. Caught off guard, the crewmates reacted poorly. They tied her to a stake, intending to launch her into space.

But the Witch was not one to back down. Drawing upon her knowledge, she cast a spell on each of them, one by one. As she set a timer on their lives, they were filled with terror at what might happen when the countdown ended.

To this day, itâ€™s said that if you hear a faint "Tick... tick... tick..." while wandering around Polus, you should count your minutes carefully. Because the Witch ensured that they would never forget her.
