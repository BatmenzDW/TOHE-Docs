Meet the Bounty Hunter. As his name suggests, he specializes in tracking down targets, acting as the assistant to The Butcher. Equipped with night vision goggles, camo gear, and heat-detecting technology, he’s prepared for any challenge. But he doesn’t just hunt anyone at random; The Butcher provides him with a specific list of crew members and neutrals to target.

Every successful hunt allows him to take a small bite of his catch, replenishing his cooldown. However, if he mistakenly kills someone not on the list and eats them, his cooldown actually increases—a risky game he plays.

One day, while delivering some meat to The Mastermind, a conversation unfolded.

The Mastermind: “Bounty Hunter, right?”

Bounty Hunter: “Yup.”

The Mastermind: “I’ve heard great things about your work.”

Bounty Hunter: “So?”

The Mastermind: “This organization could use someone like you for important missions. What do you think?”

Bounty Hunter: “No thanks.”

The Mastermind: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t dismiss it so quickly.”

Bounty Hunter: “I’ve made up my mind. I’m fine. But if you really need my help, just call. I might be there.”

With that, he left the conversation hanging.

Now, with each mission, he continues his relentless pursuit. You can’t run, and you can’t hide. He’s out for blood and flesh—none other than THE Bounty Hunter.
