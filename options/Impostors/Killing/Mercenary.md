Prologue

“How long do I have left, Doc?” asked the little bean, still reeling from the catastrophic Mira Reactor explosion of 2999. The doctor sighed, glancing at the readouts. “Two months, tops. Maybe less. Your organs are deteriorating at an alarming rate.”

Chapter 1: The Countdown

The mercenary, plagued by high doses of radioactivity, felt his body failing him. This misfortune struck just after he had finally become an Impostor two games ago. Now, with death looming, he realized he had only one option: find unwilling donors.

Chapter 2: Unleashing the Power

Though stripped of his usual powers, the mercenary was an active and ruthless killer. He understood that his only chance of survival lay in stealing the organs of his victims. Over five days of recovery, he immersed himself in the study of surgery, determined to learn how to perform the necessary procedures.

Chapter 3: Back in Action

With his newfound knowledge, the mercenary returned to his deadly ways. However, a constant fear loomed over him: his organs could fail at any moment. He had to keep killing to sustain himself or risk an untimely end.

Chapter 4: The Killing Spree

“Kill, kill, and kill” became his motto. Surprisingly, performing surgery wasn’t as difficult as he had anticipated. He accumulated a stash of organs, but the radioactivity continued to wreak havoc on his own body, diminishing them at a rapid pace.

Chapter 5: The Journey

Traveling from Skeld to Polus for the next game, the mercenary prepared backup plans: A) Use the remaining piled-up organs, or B) Consider cryonics—freezing himself to buy time.

Chapter 6: The Final Countdown

On Polus, the mercenary felt death creeping closer. With only twenty seconds left, the fearful crewmates—mostly engineers and mechanics—were hiding in vents, evading him. As his liver failed and his heart began to falter, he realized this was it.

Conclusion: A Philosophical Question

The mercenary was a resourceful and cunning individual, adept at utilizing his circumstances. But as he faced his end, one question lingered: “Are you still the same person after all this?”
