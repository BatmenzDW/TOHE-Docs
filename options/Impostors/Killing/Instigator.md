Prologue

The Instigator was a charismatic character, always feeling destined to be an impostor. He had a knack for understanding emotions, and he patiently awaited his moment.

Two Years Later

The Instigator was done waiting. Today was the best day of his life—he had finally become an impostor! He possessed a unique talent: the ability to instill fear, anger, and guilt in others.

Game 1: The Beginning of Chaos

The Instigator was on a roll, having taken down three crewmates in quick succession. He craved more chaos.

Suddenly, the game took a turn. BODY REPORTED
Three Dead Bodies Found
“I saw him kill—self!”
“Instant report, no bait message!”
“He’s lying!”

Everyone piled on the accusations against the reporter, who hadn’t even had a chance to defend himself. The reporter was actually a marshal who still had tasks to complete.

With two impostors remaining, the Instigator seized the opportunity. He approached one of those who had voted against him.

“He was innocent! You’ve ruined his chance! You’re a monster for doing this,” he said, dripping with feigned concern. “You can’t let this go. We can’t have someone like you in our midst!”

Gaslighting 101

His manipulative skills were effective; the crewmate began to crumble under the weight of guilt and doubt. In a moment of despair, they took drastic action against themselves.

With his cunning instigation, the Instigator remained hidden in the shadows, his identity safe. He reveled in the success of his tactics, knowing he had outsmarted them all.

“This much waiting was worth it,” he murmured, ready for his next games at Mira HQ.
