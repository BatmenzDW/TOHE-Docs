Prologue:
On a sunny day in the village of Madcove, the residents enjoyed their lessons with the Masters, the esteemed teachers of the community. They learned the art of stealth‚Äîhow to strike without being seen.

Chapter 1: The Gifted Apprentice
In a bustling classroom, the Master called forth a young bean who exhibited remarkable potential. The skill of shooting darts without revealing oneself was challenging, but this little bean embraced the challenge with determination.

Chapter 2: A Change of Scenery
As time went on, the village faced a dire drought, and the land became unproductive. The villagers pleaded for assistance from HQ, but the barren land offered no solutions. Eventually, everyone had to migrate to Mira HQ. While many took on menial jobs, the bean found himself fortunate enough to work directly within HQ.

Chapter 3: The Call to Action
One fateful day, the familiar Among Us theme echoed through the halls. The young bean realized that this was his moment. With a knife in hand, he prepared to make his mark. However, chaos erupted when a body was discovered, and the alarm was raised.

Chapter 4: Quick Thinking
Panicking at the thought of being caught on his first day, the bean quickly formulated a plan. He pulled out his dart gun and aimed carefully, eliminating the reporter before anyone could react. The sirens wailed as news of the incident spread through HQ.

Chapter 5: A New Identity
In the ensuing meeting, the young bean listened as accusations flew. To divert suspicion, he adopted the nickname "The Councillor," presenting himself as a figure of authority. "Either behave, or face the consequences!" he declared, asserting his newfound power.

Conclusion:
With cunning and skill, the little bean transformed from an eager apprentice into a figure to be reckoned with. In the world of shadows and strategy, he found his place among the most formidable players.
