Prologue

In this unusual world, every crewmate has a button embedded within them for reporting emergencies. However, some crewmates were manufactured without this crucial feature, leaving them vulnerable.

Chapter 1: The Seeker

One day, an impostor roamed the map, hunting for targets. He came across a lifeless body and spotted the button. For now, he decided to ignore it and focused on tracking down the last crewmate.

Chapter 2: A Sinister Discovery

After the game concluded, the impostor entered the laboratory, where a mortician was examining the bodies. With a sly grin, he approached the mortician and swiftly eliminated him. “Time to investigate,” he murmured, examining the body closely.

He noticed something intriguing: the button could be tampered with before being pressed. The impostor had a devious idea—he could create a virus that would travel through these buttons, injecting it into the crewmates.

Chapter 3: The Experiment Begins

The impostor captured two crewmates and swiftly eliminated one. He then instructed the other to press the button, unaware of the trap. As the impostor had contaminated the fallen crewmate, pressing the button transferred the virus to the other crewmate, leading to their demise.

Chapter 4: Sabotage Unfolds

In the next round, the impostor triggered a sabotage at the left reactor. He took down the crewmate guarding it and continued to eliminate anyone who came near. The unsuspecting crewmates fell, unaware of the hidden danger surrounding them.

Chapter 5: The Origin of Chaos

This dark plan had its roots in the impostor's childhood fascination with chemistry and its effects. Those early experiments had led him down a path of manipulation and deceit.

Chapter 6: The Final Confrontation

As suspicion grew, the sheriff began to piece together the impostor’s schemes. He approached the scene of the fallen crewmates and spotted the impostor, who wore a confident smile. Realizing he had to act quickly, the sheriff prepared to confront the impostor and restore order.

Epilogue

In a world of cunning and strategy, one must always stay alert. Underestimating opponents can lead to unexpected consequences, as clever minds will always find a way to adapt.
