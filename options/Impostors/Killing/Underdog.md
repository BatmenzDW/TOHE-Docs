The Underdog

The Underdog was an introverted soul, always wary of his surroundings. Spawned in Polus, he often felt sidelined, like an infant left to fend for himself. Though anger simmered beneath his quiet demeanor, his shyness kept him from speaking up.

One fateful day, during the monthly Impostor election conducted by Mr. Sloth in the Among Us universe, the Underdog was unexpectedly selected as an Impostor. This twist of fate intrigued him.

In the map, he hovered near the table, contemplating his next move. He couldn’t afford to be caught. With determination, he stashed his knives near the lower vent in the office, readying himself for the right moment.

As the number of crewmates dwindled, he began to regain his confidence. With fewer eyes watching, he sensed an opportunity to strike. The Underdog retrieved his knives and, with a swift SLASH, eliminated those who had overlooked him in his earlier days.

Meanwhile, outside the game, Dr. Moe observed the vanilla version of Among Us and pondered the concept of the Underdog. "What about the original Underdog?" he mused, reflecting on the character's journey.

And with that thought, the Underdog was cast into the vastness of space.
