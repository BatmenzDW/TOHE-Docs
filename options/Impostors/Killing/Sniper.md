You can shoot players from far away. You have to shapeshift twice to make a successful snipe. Imagine an Arrow from your Shapeshift location to your Unshift location, thatâ€™s the way the bullet will go. The snipe kills the first person in its path. You cannot kill normally until you use up all of your ammo.
