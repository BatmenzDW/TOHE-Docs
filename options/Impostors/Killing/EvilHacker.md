Prologue

The Evil Hacker was notorious for his exceptional skills in deciphering even the smallest missteps in digital security. Stealthy and highly intelligent, he was known as the go-to expert for all things tech-related.

Chapter 1: A Warning Ignored

Cunning and perceptive, the Evil Hacker could anticipate attacks or viruses with ease. He double-checked every link, trusting no oneâ€”not quite like the author of this story. One day at school, he witnessed a classmate confronted by a pop-up that read, "Congratulations! You won!!" with a suspicious link beneath it. Just as the Hacker warned, "That's a suspicious link!" the student clicked it without hesitation.

Chapter 2: A Different Path

After graduation, the Hacker dreamed of a normal life as a crewmate, free from paranoia and eager to complete his tasks over five years. However, Mr. Sloth had other plansâ€”he made the Hacker an Impostor.

Chapter 3: A Curious Discovery

While navigating through Admin, a crewmate found himself caught off guard. Before he could react, he was gone. The Hacker, observing from the shadows, noticed an external cable point at the Admin table. Intrigued, he plugged in and unleashed a virus, granting him access to all the data on his phone. This was incredible!

Chapter 4: Accusations Fly

"I SAW HIM!" a distressed crewmate shouted as the numbers dwindled to just three. "I SAW POLITES KILL!" But Polites, the calm and collected Hacker, simply replied, "I was in Admin, brother."

"Proof?" the crewmate pressed.
"Well, you were in Lab, and she was in Electrical."
"That's insane!" they cried as the group voted to eject the innocent reporter, swayed by false accusations.

Chapter 5: A New Power

After the game ended, the Hacker eagerly awaited the next round. As he approached the ejection tube, he hacked into its system, gaining the ability to modify messages. This was a game-changer! He transformed into the Bard, a powerful Artificial Intelligence capable of manipulating the game from within.
