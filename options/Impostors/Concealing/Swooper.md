The vials in specimen began to shake. It was the Chameleon navigating through the specimens, turning invisible as it activated Simon Says. Suddenly, the blue vial erupted, engulfing the unfortunate bean once again. Within the center of the large blue vial lay a knife, and the blue goop twisted the beanâ€™s thoughts, enticing it to join the Impostor's side.

Desperate to rid itself of the goo, the bean discovered it could turn invisible and strike simultaneously. In that moment of realization, it transformed into the Swooper.
