The Wildling was once a normal crew member who was quite grossed out by vents. One day, he was watching the security cameras when he saw a Neutral Killer rip over the carcass of his target and shield himself.

Even though he was a crew member, he knew that killing even one person would convert him into an Impostor. He always feared that Sheriffs would be lurking around the corners of Skeld, so he could never gather the courage to do so.

In the end, he understood that if he killed a crewmate, he could wear the dead corpse just long enough to run away.

When he finally did it, he became an Impostor—bloodthirsty and hungry to kill...

Never had he thought he would go into the disgusting vents.

He had a great strategy to shapeshift and become nearly immortal while killing.

But one flaw: he could never vent, and this was his doom.

Doom, meaning his execution by the Sheriff. Or was it?

The Wildling was ejected. Two Impostors remaining.

Rest in peace, but vents are way too important (that’s a life lesson).

How do I know this?

I am the Security Camper. 🙂
