The Undertaker was the typical school nerd, well-informed about the workings of quantum physics. One day, he had had enough. The bullies who kept tormenting him were too much to bear.

He knew how to kill, alright, but in his heart, he didn’t want to be found out; after all, he had a reputation to maintain. He was well-versed in the art of killing, but in the end, there was only one way he wouldn’t be caught: if he used his brain. 🧠

He devised a plan: whenever he used an ability, it would create a rift that teleported the dead corpses away—thanks to quantum physics. But after his revenge, he became a bit too comfortable with killing. He made it his hobby, using his intellect for evil.

He transformed into THE UNDERDOG, but he didn’t like that name, so he thought of himself as an underdog who took other people’s lives to become The Undertaker.

In the end, one thing was off: it took too much energy for him to maintain his methods. He froze in place for a few seconds.

Ultimately, he was caught by the Sheriff, the Reverie, and the Knight. But that story is for another time.
