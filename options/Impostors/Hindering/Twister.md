As the Twister, you can use shape-shifting to randomly swap the position of all players. The swap happens twice, once when you start your shape shift and once when you return to your original appearance.<br>
The Twister itself will not swap places with anyone and players who are in vents cannot be teleported.

Now the twister was an... Ordinary? Fellow who was keenly interested in science and reading
Defo Not the Author
Now the Twister was interested in teleportation and disassembling atoms... Strange!

Indeed it was strange but very easy for the twister to understand
Ill try to explain how the twister explained to the author in the twister's final breath
Basically you go on take one of the atoms of the body break it down store the information let AI do its thing and reassemble it thereby easily teleporting the beans all around the map
But wait this required energy
Huh....
Well energy can be obtained by doing activities that release heat like.. Making of an egg during shapeshifting and... Going back from being shapeshifted
But now the thing was... This teleported them twice which made it both difficult for the Twister and easy since it broke the bonds and groups of people but it was also difficult to find people during so many teleportations
One drawback was that this was done with a sort of rain particle so people in vents were NOT influenced and this was a problem since they might eavesdrop on seeing The twister Shapeshift
Huh... Maybe not as good of a technique thought the twister but that's the best he could do and well....
That's it why are you still reading?
Oh you want Impostor games?
The Impostor games had just started and the Twister was a part of it going all around killing other impostors the twister started making others feel nauseated from being disassembled and assembled way, way too many times
Now? Yes Now
THE END! :D

And yes the twist also is that the author removed chapters from this
